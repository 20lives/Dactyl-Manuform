## The Dactyl-ManuForm keyboard: Opposable Thumb Edition

This, the DMOTE, is a fork of the
[Dactyl-ManuForm](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard), a parametrized,
split-hand, concave, columnar, ergonomic keyboard. In this fork, the thumb
cluster has been modified to minimize shearing forces.

Parameters have been moved out of the application code itself, into separate
files that are safe and easy to edit. Use them to change:

- Switch type: ALPS or MX.
- Size and shape.
    - Row and column curvature and tilt (tenting).
    - Exceptions at any level, down to the position of individual keys.
- Minor features like LED strips and wrist rests.
